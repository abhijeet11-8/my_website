title: "Diffusion model with deterministic noising"
date: "2025-08"
---

Semester project (Aug–Apr 2025) supervised by Prof. MS Santhanam at IISER Pune.

Summary:

- Replaced stochastic noise in diffusion models with deterministic chaotic dynamics to make sampling and training more energy- and compute-efficient.
- Eliminated the need for reverse stochastic processes by using deterministic noising schedules.
- Applied method to text and image generation diffusion models and analyzed trade-offs between determinism and stochasticity.

Status: project work (semester project).
