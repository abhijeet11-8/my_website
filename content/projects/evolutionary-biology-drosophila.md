Summer project (Jun–Jul 2025) supervised by Prof. Sutirth Dey, IISER Pune.

Summary:

- Standardized the spatial kernel with a Drosophila Activity Monitor and analyzed activity data.
- Built a Drosophila larvae activity tracker to study dispersal and selection pressure effects on larval dispersal ability.
- Performed data cleaning and analysis using SciPy, NumPy, matplotlib, and OpenCV.
