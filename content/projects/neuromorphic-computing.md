Winter project (Dec–Jan) supervised by Prof. Ayon Borthakur — Neuromorphic computing research.

Summary:

- Studied spiking neural networks and compared performance and properties with traditional ANNs.
- Investigated learnable initial membrane potentials and heterogeneities in neuron models.

Applications: classification and energy-efficient architectures.
