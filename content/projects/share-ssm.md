We proposed SHaRe-SSM for wearable devices: a second-order spiking state-space model (SSM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance on human activity recognition datasets and PPG/EEG datasets while being extremely energy-efficient.

Key points:

- Energy-efficient second-order spiking SSM architecture for time-series wearables.
- Outperforms first-order SSMs on long-sequence classification tasks and is competitive with ANN-based approaches.
- Explored discretization methods and network heterogeneities; proposed kernel-based regression extensions for long-range regression tasks.
